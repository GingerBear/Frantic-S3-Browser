Setup: The website bucket for Siirrin
=====================================
*Add a new bucket using https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home - pay attention
taht you place the bucket in the region you want it to be in. This bucket
is called "the website bucket" in the Siirrin documentation and is used
to serve the login website to your users. You can customize it to match
your brand.

*Add Bucket Policy for Website Access
Select the bucket, press "Properties". In the Permissions tab press
"Add Bucket Policy". Paste this in, replacing "YOURBUCKETNAME" with the name
of your bucket:

{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
             {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "*"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME/*"
             }
    ]
}

Save the policy.

*Enable Website Access
Select the "Website Access" tab in Properties. Check Enabled [X], specify
"index.html" as the Index Document and "error.html" as the Error Document.
Note the endpoint Amazon gives to you and write it down. Press Save.

*Upload all files of Siirrin to the root of the website bucket you just created.

Setup: The bucket for a single customer's data
==============================================
*Add the bucket
Add a new bucket using https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home - pay attention
that you place the bucket in the region you want it to be in.

*Add a CORS policy to enable API requests
Go back to Permissions tab and press "Add a CORS policy". Paste this in:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>

*Add the user to access the bucket. Go to IAM, add a new user.
Save the Security Credentials, you will need them later in the setup.
Select the user's Permissions tab and add a Policy as follows.

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1353931095381",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME","arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

*Repeat this procedure for each customer bucket you need.
